# Trading_Programs
  
This is the Node foldere to various trading programs. This may be in the form as simple analysis, trading algorithms or general random test scripts. Time will tell...


Index:
- Watchlist.csv 
    Contains all stocks that are in my watchlist. Basis for inputs into each program if personal perference is desired.
    
- StopLoss_StopGain
    Simple calculation that picks up realtime ticker prices and outputs stoploss and stopgain figures based on your own measures. Nothing crazy. Potential for integration into later trading system process for automatic trading.
    
- Twitter DataFeed
    Polling Twitter for Sentiment on Stocks. One of a few measures to help calculate market sentiment.
